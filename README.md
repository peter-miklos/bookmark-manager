# Bookmark-Manager

```
As a makers student,
so that I access saved links
I want to see a list of links

As a makers student,
so that i can revisit sites,
i want to be able to add new links to bookmark

As a makers students
so that I can group similar links
i want to be able to add tags to links

As a makers students
so that I can find relevant links easily
I want to be able to filter links
```
